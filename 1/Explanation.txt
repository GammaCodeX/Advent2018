So since the first one is so simple, I spent some time getting set up.
I've made an input reader and made some proof of concept specs.

I do not expect to go this deep on every one of the challenges,
while they can probably be done in a line or two (this one can be done in a line easily)
But a setup like this will prepare me for when I do need more organic growth of the code

Having tried this now I also think I will just parse the input directly into an INPUT constant next time

Run Solution.rb from a console to find the answer to this challenge
